## 08/11/2017 - From Curriculum and Record Keeping for Beginners Sherry Veach (2014)

- Research the different methods, study and pray
- Plan for each child
  - Math, History, Science, Writing, Reading, Grammar, Handwriting, Spelling, Vocabulary, Fine Arts
    - Each subject not every day, month, or year (sometimes not every year, especially younger kids)

- Rainbow resource - free catalog (do not accept ones you pay for)
- Get lots of catalogs - send free catalogs
- Walk through curriculum fair - dont buy anything, grab catalogs - look at reviews and decide from there...
- Look through the books from the fair, flip through and think about your children as you do it

- Prayed and fasted before the fairs - you will be able to feel its the right thing
- Pray and fast for help -- as I build the system

- Don't get a GED, Instead do a compass test and go through HSLDA to ensure your child gets a high school transcript
	- https://app.hslda.org/r2/#/ -- MUST HAVE - Free counseling, lawyers and other discounts for $100 per year or $1000 for lifetime

- Before getting curriculum, talk to someone who has used it before, don't just talk to the vendors

## 08/11/2017 - Setup the schedule according to the child - My personal contemplating
1. Schedule Page - Decide on school days and time to start
  - Assume school days are every weekday except holidays, so schedule holidays -- choose the weeks that the children will be doing school (must be between 33-36)
  - Choose school time hours, including how many days a week
  - Choose the start/starting date for school (doesn't matter if it already started)

  TODO:  
  - Find a simple way to create your homeschool weeks (33 - 36)
    - Create the schedule for each week, then auto-create each week as a homeschool, when populating, show how many weeks are homeschool weeks (initially starting with 52 weeks â€” each week)
    - Create suggestions for holidays, then also suggestions for a normal schooling holidays, summer, Christmas, etc.
  - Allow adding All-day tasks, and any tasks to a given day, and be able to make lists in a calendar

2. Students Page - Add students for your class
  - Subjects for 2017
    - Suggestions: Math, History, Science, Writing, Reading, Grammar, Handwriting, Spelling, Vocabulary, Fine Arts
      - Khan Academy will elaborate upon some of these
  - Decide which subjects each student needs to work on.
  - Choose what type of schedule the child would like to use
    - List-based
      - You need to do Math 3 times a week (TODO)
        - The tasks you need to complete for that week are as follows...
    - Time-based
      - At this time, you will do Math, then History, etc (TODO)
3. Tasks Page - Adding assignments and tasks for the student to accomplish, based on the subjects and schedule type
4. Assistant Page - Connect to Alexa or Google Home
  - Use the schedule you made and make a customized experience for morning and night routines
5. Try it out!
